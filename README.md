This demo is based on top of this template: https://github.com/valnub/Framework7-Typescript-Template
For some people this is a little complicated because it relies on npm and grunt. If you want an alternative with just pure html, css and javascript without a build process involved you can try this alternative: https://github.com/valnub/Framework7-Pure-Angular-Template
