## Template

This app is based on top of this template: https://github.com/valnub/Framework7-Typescript-Template

### Alternative, easier template

For some people the template mentioned above is a little to complicated because it relies on npm and grunt. If you want an alternative with just pure html, css and javascript without a build process involved you can try this alternative: https://github.com/valnub/Framework7-Pure-Angular-Template
